<h3><strong>About the coder</strong></h3>

<hr />

<p>Hello my name is Hanifati. Most people call me Hani because it's easier. I code and design websites. (<em>Still an amateur so I am studying a bit too!</em>) I live in California, but I long for a chance of adventure or travel somewhere one day. I daydream a lot, and I still have an expansive imagination. Besides being a coder, I am a long-time writer. I dream of writing a small book full of my own stories or poems. It is still in a long process, but I will get there one day.</p>

<h3><strong>My education</strong></h3>

<hr />

<p>My education was simple. I went to Pacific Coast High School in Tustin, CA. I graduated from there in 2013. In 2014 - 2015, I went to El Camino College in Torrance to take some classes to transfer into a four-year university. However, I quit after a short stint. There isn't much to say, but rather a lack of interest and feeling like I couldn't catch up with the rest of my peers. I decided to explore my options. </p>

<p>A cousin of mine who was a coder themselves recommended to me to go to Beach Coders Academy in El Segundo, towards the end of 2015. I couldn't see myself doing computers or learning to code. I thought it would be hard at first. I was proven wrong, immediately, as I took a course. The course name was Front End Web Development: Codewave, and it was a fun course. I learned many things like of HTML/CSS and Javascript/JQuery. I finished the course in 2016.</p>
